Deployed application link: https://msnow-21.github.io/Code_Quiz/

Project: The Code_Quiz application is a series of five multiple choice questions that the user is asked to complete. To start the application, the user must click the Start Quiz button and the first question is displayed. When the first question displays a timer can be seen in the upper right hand corner that counts down 75 seconds. For correctly answered questions, points are added to the score, and the quiz moves on to the next question to be answered. Incorrect questions, on the other hand, remove time from the clock, while also proceeding to the next question. Once the quiz is completed, the user is asked to enter in their initials. Initials and the scores are then displayed. A set of high scores will be shown and displayed on the highscores page.
